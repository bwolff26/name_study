I projected I wanted to do for quite some time based upon various texts. A shoutout to my data science professor that loved the idea too. However, the biggest restraint with this project will be the lack of reliable data for what will likely be very sensitive topic.

Unfortunately I expect progress to be slow and minimal, particularly as I do not anticipate finding much data to really unearth what I'm interested in trying to prove empirically. Even the below source from SS only has their names - not even their years lived. However, it's at least on the topic so perhaps in hope of getting more inspiration/jolt to continue later let us at least do this.
